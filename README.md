# Financial-Econometrics
Some Codes from my Financial econometrics course homework that I wrote.
data.xlsx contains data on daily returns on different indexes 
(all series with JPM in the name are bond indexes, all series with MSCI in the name are stock indexes and then we have the dol- lar daily returns on yen, GB pound and Euro). 
I used USbond, USstock and euro exchange rate returns and computed the correlogram and the Jarque Bera tests for the series and the squared of the series. 
2.Compute the IID tests for the US bond , US stock and euro series 
estimate a ARCH(1) model for US bond and US stock of the kind:
yt = c+φ1×yt−1+ut ht = α0+α1×u2t−1
3.Verify the presence of ARCH effects in Using OLS and MLE method  
4.Find an analytical expression for the kurtosis of ut, the process used in 3)
5 Estimate a GARCH(1,1) model for US bond and US stock. 
Test for the significance of the GARCH coefficients. 
Obtain and plot the series of the standardised residuals:
u ̃ t
􏰀h ̃ (1) t
